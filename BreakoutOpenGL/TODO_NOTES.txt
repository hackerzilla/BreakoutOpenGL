6. *DONE* Clear the screen to a solid color. *DONE* 
The last 2 steps took about 3 because I kept having an exception thrown being caused by

7. Draw a triangle on the screen 
7a. Create shader
7b. Create vertex array object
8b. Put code to clear screen and draw data every frame
9. Let the player move the triangle up/down/left/right using WASD or Arrow Keys 
9a. Import the glm math library to use for matrix transformations
